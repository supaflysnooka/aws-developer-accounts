## Verification Commands

Run these commands to verify your deployment:

```bash
# Verify AWS Organizations
aws organizations describe-organization

# List OUs
aws organizations list-organizational-units-for-parent \
  --parent-id $(aws organizations list-roots --query 'Roots[0].Id' --output text)

# Check Control Tower
aws controltower list-landing-zones

# List budgets
aws budgets describe-budgets \
  --account-id $(aws sts get-caller-identity --query Account --output text)

# Verify state backend
aws s3 ls s3://your-bucket-name/

# Check DynamoDB locks table
aws dynamodb describe-table --table-name terraform-state-locks
```

## Emergency Contacts

Document these before deployment:

- [ ] AWS Support contact method
- [ ] Internal escalation path
- [ ] Terraform expert contact
- [ ] Security team contact
- [ ] Finance/billing contact
- [ ] On-call procedures documented

## Rollback Plan

Prepare rollback procedures:

- [ ] State file backup procedure documented
- [ ] Manual resource cleanup steps documented
- [ ] Terraform destroy order documented
- [ ] Emergency break-glass procedure
- [ ] Communication plan for rollback

## Success Criteria

Deployment is successful when:

- [ ] All modules deployed without errors
- [ ] All email subscriptions confirmed
- [ ] No drift detected in Control Tower
- [ ] Test account created successfully
- [ ] SCPs working as expected
- [ ] Billing alerts functioning
- [ ] Documentation complete
- [ ] Team trained
- [ ] Monitoring in place

## Common Issues Preparation

Be prepared for these common issues:

- [ ] S3 bucket name collision (have backup name ready)
- [ ] IAM permission errors (ensure AdministratorAccess)
- [ ] State lock issues (know how to force-unlock)
- [ ] Email confirmation delay (check spam folder)
- [ ] Control Tower deployment timeout (be patient, can take 90 min)
- [ ] SCP blocking legitimate action (know how to detach)
- [ ] Budget threshold too low (can adjust after deployment)

## Time Estimates

Plan your deployment window:

| Module | Deployment Time | Post-Deploy Time |
|--------|----------------|------------------|
| terraform-backend | 15 minutes | 10 minutes |
| organization | 30 minutes | 30 minutes |
| control-tower | 60-90 minutes | 45 minutes |
| scp-policies | 10 minutes | 30 minutes |
| billing-alerts | 15 minutes | 15 minutes |
| **Total** | **2-3 hours** | **2 hours** |

**Recommended**: Schedule a 4-hour window for full deployment and validation.

## Final Pre-Flight Check

Before starting deployment:

- [ ] All checkboxes above completed
- [ ] Time window scheduled
- [ ] Team notified
- [ ] Backup plan ready
- [ ] Support contacts available
- [ ] Coffee ready â˜•

## Ready to Deploy?

If all checkboxes are complete, you're ready to proceed with deployment!

Start with: `cd bootstrap/terraform-backend`

Good luck! ðŸš€
